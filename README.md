# FooBar the Code Librarian

FooBar the Code Librarian is a project that can help developers navigate and understand their codebases more easily. It will combine a structured code index with an LLM-powered assistant to answer developer questions and suggest code improvements.

## Overview

- **Structured Indexing:**  
  The application will use Apache Lucene to index source code in a structured way. It will break code files into components such as classes, methods, javadocContent, parameters, packages, and return types, enabling precise and fielded searches.

- **LLM-Powered Query Processing:**  
  The system will integrate a large language model (LLM) API. When a developer asks a question, the LLM will decide whether to use its built-in coding knowledge or perform a search on the indexed code to deliver a context-specific answer.

## How It Will Work

1. **Indexing the Codebase:**  
   - Users will specify a directory containing Java (and later possibly multiple other languages) source files.
   - The tool will parse each file to extract key elements.
   - Apache Lucene will create a detailed index of these elements.

2. **Processing User Queries:**  
   - When a query is submitted (for example, "find methods that accept a String and return a boolean",or "help me find a method in this package that does ...") the system will use a custom prompt to instruct the LLM to act as a coding librarian.
   - The LLM will search the index and combine the results with its own coding knowledge to provide a clear answer.

3. **Generating Responses:**  
   - The LLM will produce responses that include code snippets and explanations.
   - This approach will help ensure the answers are accurate and relevant to the specific codebase.

## Benefits

- **Time Savings:**  
  Developers can quickly locate and understand relevant parts of a large codebase without time consuming manual searches.

- **Context-Aware Assistance:**  
  By combining a detailed index with LLM support, the tool will provide accurate and useful insights.

- **Improved Code Quality:**  
  The tool supports better debugging, refactoring, and documentation by offering targeted recommendations.

## Possible Improvements

- **Multi-Language Support:**  
  The project could be expanded to include other languages such as Python, C++, and JavaScript.

- **Enhanced Editor Integration:**  
  The project could allow for real-time code modification suggestions within popular code editors.


## Conclusion

This proposal outlines my vision for the project and the planned approach. I believe that once completed, FooBar the Code Librarian could be a useful tool in managing and improving large codebases. As well as aiding developers to write code in unfamiliar languages.
